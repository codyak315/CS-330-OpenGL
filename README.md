How do I approach designing software?
  -What new design skills has your work on the project helped you to craft?
  
  If I'm being honest with myself a lot of the "design" of my program was derived from the tutorials, as I did not have any experience, and when starting off very little confidence in what I was doing to really provide much value in the realm of software design, I was primarily concerned with function.
  
  -What design process did you follow for your project work?
  
  As said before design wasn't really a focus, but I suppose you could argue that the process I had gone through with the various tutorials would not be unlike jumping onto a work project on the job, where you have no clue what is going on and have to get the lay of the land yourself. In that regards I would say I had a strong "observe and follow" design process.
  
  -How could tactics from your design approach be applied in future work?
  
  Kind of dipping back on my previous answer, I think the concept and scenario of tacking work on a project that has already begun and in the middle of development that you were not a part of at the beginning would be a comparable situation that one would likely find themselves in the software field. In that regard I feel the same processes I employed for this assignment would have carryover to that future situation.
  
  
How do I approach developing programs?
  -What new development strategies did you use while working on your 3D scene?
  
  I'm not sure I can pinpoint any development strategy I would classify as "new" but I will say that I really pushed my boundaries in the trial and error department. For quite a few aspects of this project I feel like I had found just about every way something didn't work before I came to something functional. In that regards I would say employing an interative approach was one of the most important strategies for working on my 3D scene.
  
  -How did iteration factor into your development?
  
  As mentioned in the previous prompt, iteration was a very large portion of my design process. I would scheme out an idea in my mind of how I thought something might work, code it, run it, and then troubleshoot. Troubleshooting typically consisted of tweaking code using elements that I knew functioned correctly into the code I was writing, that way I could potentially isolate where the issues were occuring and avoid spending excessive time on code that wasn't the problem. 
  
  -How has your approach to developing code evolved throughout the milestones, which led you to the projectâ€™s completion?
  
  I think perhaps the biggest evolution of my code throughout the milestones came down to confidence. In the beginning I was intimidated by the material and that intimidation kind of paralyzed me from applying the knowledge I already had from outside the course to OpenGL. As I started understanding more and more components of OpenGL, and I became comfortable with the render and createmesh functions, as well as the two shader programs I was able to start applying common sense and basic coding knowledge to the program to get the results that I wanted, such as using booleans in the fragment shader program and changing their values from the render function to change the scalars for different objects in the scene.  
  
  
How can computer science help me in reaching my goals?
  -How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future educational pathway?
  
  I've mentioned in the design document that one of the most rewarding parts of this course has been overcoming the challenge that was learning OpenGL, It was a great confidence boost considering I was quite nervous in the first half of the term. On the other hand though I do feel that graphics and the more artistic side of computer science if often overlooked. People are always in need of logo's and graphics to enhance their products and having that knowledge to be able to provide a custom solution can absolutely be a step up on the competition in the job market.
